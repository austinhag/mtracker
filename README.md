mtracker

This application was created as a Raspberry Pi project to detect when my toddler daughter gets out of her room at night and roams the halls of our house.  It uses OpenCV for facial tracking and recognition and the Google Assistant Relay (https://github.com/greghesp/assistant-relay) for triggering actions on Google Home (turning on our bedroom lights and broadcasting a warning over the speaker).

For the application to work, a Raspberry Pi with camera is required.  Further, Google Assistant Relay should be actively running on a device on your network (it could be the same Raspberry Pi).
